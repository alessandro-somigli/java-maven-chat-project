/**
 * The com.chat.client package contains the resources needed to implement a TCP client that
 * connects to a {@link com.chat.server server} and is able to communicate with other clients. <br>
 * It also features a JavaFX Application and user interface (UI) for a smoother
 * and more intuitive user experience (UX).
 *
 * <p>
 *      It consists of a {@link com.chat.client.Client Client} class that connects to the server,
 *      communicates with it and handles responses, as well as three sub-packages to expand its functionality.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     The sub-packages are arranged accordingly:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link com.chat.client.chat chat}</li>
 *     <li>{@link com.chat.client.event event}</li>
 *     <li>{@link com.chat.client.ui ui}</li>
 * </ul>
